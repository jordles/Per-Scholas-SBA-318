# Per Scholas SBA 318 Express Server Application

I MADE MY VERY OWN FIRST API!!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ I really enjoyed this assignment. 

For logins.js, it is supposed to be locked under an admin key but according to the rubric, this should be avoided for testing convenience.  

I made a middleware folder, and added a middleware that fetches a random salt, and uses that salt in my other middleware where i hash the password. Both these results are used in my POST request for users. 

For my tester, when using POST requests for <code>/users /logins /posts</code>, feel free to copy and paste these sample bodies for your convenience:

## Requirements/Tracking

| Requirement | Weight | Finished |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Create and use at least two pieces of custom middleware. | 5% |  |
| Create and use error-handling middleware | 5% |  |
| Use at least three different data categories (e.g., users, posts, or comments). | 5% |  |
| Utilize reasonable data structuring practices. | 5% |  |
| Create GET routes for all data that should be exposed to the client. | 5% |  |
| Create POST routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client creation via a POST request. | 5% |  |
| Create PATCH or PUT routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client manipulation via a PATCH or PUT request. | 5% |  |
| Create DELETE routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client deletion via a DELETE request. | 5% |  |
| Include query parameters for data filtering, where appropriate. At least one data category should allow for additional filtering through the use of query parameters. <br><br> Note: DO NOT use API keys; this makes it more difficult for instructors to grade finished projects efficiently. | 5% |  |
| Utilize route parameters, where appropriate. | 5% |  |
| Adhere to the guiding principles of REST. | 10% |  |
| Create and render at least one view using a view template and template engine. This can be a custom template engine or a third-party engine. <br><br> If you are stuck on how to approach this, think about ways you could render the current state of your API's data for easy viewing. | 8% |  |
| Use simple CSS to style the rendered views. <br><br> Note: This is not a test of design; it is a test of serving static files using Express. The CSS can be very simple. | 2% |  |
| Include a form within a rendered view that allows for interaction with your RESTful API. | 3% |  |
| Utilize reasonable code organization practices. | 5% |  |
| Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit). | 10% |  |
| Commit frequently to the git repository. | 5% | âœ… |
| Include a README file that contains a description of your application. | 2% | âœ… |
| Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience. | 5% | âœ… |
